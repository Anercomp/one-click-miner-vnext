# One-Click Miner

The One-Click Miner allows cryptocurrency enthusiasts to get into mining with minimal effort. When you download the One-Click Miner, you will be asked to provide a password for your (built in) wallet. It will then immediately commence mining, using [P2Proxy](https://p2proxy.vertcoin.org) as mining pool. 

If you want to support the further development of the One Click Miner, feel free to donate Vertcoin to [Vmnbtn5nnNbs1otuYa2LGBtEyFuarFY1f8](https://insight.vertcoin.org/address/Vmnbtn5nnNbs1otuYa2LGBtEyFuarFY1f8).

This is a redevelopment of Vertcoin's [One Click Miner](https://github.com/vertcoin-project/one-click-miner).

This software is available for Windows and Linux.
